* NMT-combination - scripts for combining output of NMT systems
* NMT-config - example configuration files for training NMT systems with (Neural Monkey)[https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/] and (Nematus)[https://github.com/rsennrich/nematus/]
* named-entity-translation - scripts for prepairing parallel corpora with named entity tags 
* filtering - scripts for filtering parallel text files 
* scoring - scripts for scoring translations with language models

* shuffle_parallel.sh - shuffle two files of parallel sentences

The title is derrived from the authors first names (Chantal, and three Ma's - Maksym, Mark, Matiss). It's also a reference to 
[C-3PO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO) - the translation droid from Star Wars.
