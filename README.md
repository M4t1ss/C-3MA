# Scripts for Tartu Neural MT systems for WMT 17
This repository contains scripts and an example configuration files used for the Tartu Neural MT submission (C-3MA) for the shared translation task at 
the 2017 Workshops on Statistical Machine Translation [http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/](http://www.statmt.org/wmt17/)
* NMT-combination - scripts for combining output of NMT systems
* NMT-config - example configuration files for training NMT systems with [Neural Monkey](https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/) and [Nematus](https://github.com/rsennrich/nematus/)
* named-entity-translation - scripts for prepairing parallel corpora with named entity tags 
* filtering - scripts for filtering parallel text files 
* scoring - scripts for scoring translations with language models
* post-processing - scripts for post-processing output translations
* shuffle_parallel.sh - shuffle two files of parallel sentences

The title is derrived from the authors first names (Chantal, and three Ma's - Maksym, Mark, Matiss). It's also a reference to 
[C-3PO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-3PO) - the translation droid from Star Wars.
